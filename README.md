
# Firebase Setup for Your Project

This guide provides the steps to configure Firebase in your project, enabling Firebase Authentication, Firestore, and other Firebase services as needed.

## Steps for Firebase Setup

### 1. Create `dbconfig` Folder

- Navigate to the `src` directory of your project.
- Create a new folder named `dbconfig`.

This folder will store your Firebase configuration and any related settings.

### 2. Create `firebase.js` File

- Inside the `dbconfig` folder, create a file named `firebase.js`.
- Add the following code to `firebase.js`:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "",           // Add your Firebase API key here
  authDomain: "",        // Add your Firebase auth domain here
  projectId: "",         // Add your Firebase project ID here
  storageBucket: "",     // Add your Firebase storage bucket here
  messagingSenderId: "", // Add your Firebase messaging sender ID here
  appId: ""              // Add your Firebase app ID here
};

export default firebaseConfig;
```


- Note: To find these credentials, go to the Firebase Console, select your project, and navigate to Project Settings.

### 3. Enable Firebase Services
1. **Enable Firebase Authentication**
    - Go to the Firebase Console and select your project.
    - In the left-hand menu, under Build, click Authentication.
    - Click Get Started to enable authentication for your project.
    - Set up your preferred authentication methods (e.g., email/password, Google, etc.).

2. **Enable Firestore or Realtime Database**
    - In the Firebase Console, under Build, you will see options for Firestore Database or Realtime Database.
    - Choose one based on your application's needs:
    - Firestore Database: A scalable NoSQL cloud database for structured data.
    - Realtime Database: A cloud-hosted NoSQL database that stores data in JSON format and synchronizes in real-time.
    - Click Create Database and follow the on-screen instructions to configure database rules and permissions.

3. **Conclusion**
    - Your Firebase configuration is now set up. You can integrate Firebase services into your project, initialize the Firebase app, and use services like authentication and database operations.

### 4. Install Firebase SDK
- Make sure to install Firebase in your project by running the following command:
```
npm install firebase
```
